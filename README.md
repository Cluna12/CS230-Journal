- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The client was The Gaming Room. They wanted a secure, scalable, turn-based drawing game (Draw It or Lose It) that works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile with centralized game data.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I clearly defined requirements, used a strong domain model, and applied the Singleton pattern effectively.
  
- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  --It helped organize ideas, clarify constraints, and made the coding process smoother. Increased the understanding of the overall code that would need to be implemented

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would add more detail and visuals to the system architecture section to better show data flow.
  
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I focused on cross-platform support, security, and centralized game state. Meeting user needs ensures the software is usable, secure, and reliable.
  User needs are of the utmost importance as they decide the systems requirements.

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I used OOP principles, UML diagrams, and design patterns. In the future, I’d continue with clear diagrams and early stakeholder feedback.
